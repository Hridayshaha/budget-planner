# Budget Planner

This is a test application built for my practice purpose. Here I build a budget planner application from normal HTML CSS to MERN development and deploy it to any cloud server, for testing my skills. I have added here all the stages of my work to make it HTML CSS to MERN development. That means this total project case study will be added to this README file.
